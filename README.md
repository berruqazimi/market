 # üß• Second-Hand Clothes Marketplace

This is a Django-based web application that allows users to publish, update, and unpublish garments in a second-hand clothes marketplace. The application provides RESTful API endpoints for both public and authenticated users to interact with the garments.

## üìã Features

### User Authentication:
- Users can register, log in, and authenticate using JWT tokens.
- Custom user model includes fields such as full name, address, and a publisher field for garment ownership.
- Authenticated users can interact with the marketplace to publish, update, or unpublish garments.

### Garment Management:
- **Publish Garment:** Authenticated users (publishers) can publish garments with details such as type, description, size, and price.
- **Update Garment:** Publishers can update the details of their published garments.
- **Unpublish Garment:** Publishers can unpublish their own garments. Unauthorized users cannot modify garments that they do not own.

### Public Endpoints:
- **View Garments:** Public users can list and view garment details without authentication.
- **Search Garments:** Garments can be filtered by type, size, price, and other parameters.
